    #Firstly, we will convert the ranked into a set as there might be multiple scores in the leaderboard of the same value and thus of the same rank.
    #ranked = set(ranked)
    #Then, we will convert the ranked set back to a list and sort it in a descending order(we convert the set to list because we cannot slice a set). Thus the equation will be.
    ranked = sorted(list(set(ranked)), reverse=True)
    #then we will also sort the player in a reverse manner.
    player = sorted(player, reverse=True)
    
    #After performing above operations we will store the length of ranked in a variable l, assign 0 to a new variable j, and declare an empty list ans to store our answer.

    #Then we will traverse the length of player through variable i using a for loop
    for i in range(len(player)):
        #Then we will increment j by 1 using a while loop, which will execute until both of the following conditions are True
        while j<l and player[i]<ranked[j]:
            #While traversing the for loop, i.e for a player[i], if j>l then the ranked list is completely traversed so we cannot add another rank and if player[i] â‰¥ ranked[j] then rank of the player is obtained and thus we exit the while loop. At the end we return ans in a reverse manner as we had reversed both ranked and player earlier.
